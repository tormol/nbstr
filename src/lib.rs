//! A lean `Cow<'static, str>` that cannot be written to.
//!
//! Size is reduced by replacing `String` with `Box<str>``, which removes one `usize`, at the cost of some reallocation.
//!
//! To avoid boxing when possible, short `str`s can be stored inside the struct itself, replacing pointer and length.
//! The length of the short str is then stored as a part of the tag/discriminant, which is why Nbstr is a struct and not an enum.
//! The definition of 'short' depends on architecture and features.
//!
//! There are four variants of nbstr; See README for details.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate nbstr;
//! use nbstr::Nbstr;
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct Container {// <- no lifetime
//!     list: Vec<Nbstr>
//! }
//! impl Container {
//!     fn append<S:Into<Nbstr>>(&mut self,  s: S) {
//!         self.list.push(s.into());
//!     }
//! }
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut c = Container::default();
//!     c.append("foo");// &'static str
//!     {   // &str wouldn't work here since the strings goes out of scope before the Vec
//!         c.append(Nbstr::from_str(&("bar".to_string())));// is short enough to avoid allocating,
//!         c.append("baz".to_string());
//!     }
//!     println!("{:?}", c.list);
//! }
//! ```
