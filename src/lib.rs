//! A lean `Cow<'static, str>` that cannot be written to.
//!
//! Size is reduced by replacing `String` with `Box<str>``, which removes one `usize`, at the cost of some reallocation.
//!
//! To avoid boxing when possible, short `str`s can be stored inside the struct itself, replacing pointer and length.
//! The length of the short str is then stored as a part of the tag/discriminant, which is why Nbstr is a struct and not an enum.
//! The definition of 'short' depends on architecture and features.
//!
//! There are a few feature flags that can reduce struct size. See README for details.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate nbstr;
//! use nbstr::Nbstr;
//!
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct Container {// <- no lifetime
//!     list: Vec<Nbstr>
//! }
//! impl Container {
//!     fn append<S:Into<Nbstr>>(&mut self,  s: S) {
//!         self.list.push(s.into());
//!     }
//! }
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut c = Container::default();
//!     c.append("foo");// &'static str
//!     {   // &str wouldn't work here since the strings goes out of scope before the Vec
//!         c.append(Nbstr::from_str(&("bar".to_string())));// is short enough to avoid allocating,
//!         c.append("baz".to_string());
//!     }
//!     println!("{:?}", c.list);
//! }
//! ```

// Overview:
// nbstr_shared.rs: code used for all variants of Nbstr.
// nbstr_*.rs: code specific to that variant / feature.
// utf8_char.rs: helper for converting from char.

#![cfg_attr(feature="unstable", feature(associated_consts, unicode,  nonzero, unsafe_no_drop_flag))]

#![cfg_attr(feature="clippy", feature(plugin))]
#![cfg_attr(feature="clippy", plugin(clippy))]
#![cfg_attr(feature="clippy", allow(precedence, identity_op, len_without_is_empty))]
// precedence: I prefer extra spaces around the central operator.
// identity_op: keep the flow in unrolled loops.
// len_without_is_empty: UTF8Char is never empty
// needless_return:
//     {let mut z = ...; z.modify(); z} looks unfinished.
//     If a function returns early, it `return`s late for consistency.
//     Not ignored because it has caught a few occurences that didn't match those.
